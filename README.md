# Armon

Armon is a 2D CFD solver for compressible non-viscous fluids, using the finite volume method.

It was made to explore Julia's capabilities in HPC and for performance portability: it should
perform very well on any CPU and GPU.
Domain decomposition using MPI is supported.

The twin project [Armon-Kokkos](https://github.com/Keluaa/Armon-Kokkos) is a mirror of the core of
this solver (with much less options) written in C++ using the Kokkos library.
It is possible to reuse kernels from that solver in this one, using the
[Kokkos.jl](https://github.com/Keluaa/Kokkos.jl) package.
